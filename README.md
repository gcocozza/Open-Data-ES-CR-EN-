***Welcome to an Open-Data Project

The goal of this project is to collect and make available as much linguistic resources as possible in the combination of ES-CR>EN. Other language combinations are welcome as well.

If you are interested in subjects such as machine translation, deep learning technologies, then you know the importance of having a data bank of this nature for students, researchers and translators.

Sharing your data for research purposes is invaluable, and it is a practice that has widespread rapidly, particularly among EU institutions.

Sharing your data does not mean that your translations would be duplicated.

Translators would benefit the most out of this data banks as they can quiclky train an engine and customize it.

The same applies for researchers. Researchers could benefit from this data bank and draw conclusions faster if they don't have to get into the pre-production phase of crawling techniques and data preparation.

Ready-to-use datasets means more resources, faster development.

**Before you share your data, make sure of the following:

	Are your files saved in UTF-8 with Unix line breaks? 	Are your TMX files using the correct source and target language combination? 	Did you open your recently aligned translation memories to check for any tags or codes that could pollute the training datasets?
