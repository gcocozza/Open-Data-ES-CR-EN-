## Welcome to an Open-Data Project

The goal of this project is to collect and make available as much linguistic resources as possible in the combination of ES-CR>EN. Other language combinations are welcome as well. 

If you are interested in subjects such as machine translation, deep learning technologies, then you know the importance of having a data bank of this nature for students, researchers and translators. 

### Sharing your data is invaluable, and it is a practice that has widespread in the last years.
### Sharing your data does not mean that your translations would be reduplicated.
### Translators would benefit the most out of this data banks as they can quiclky train an engine and customize it.
### The same applies for researchers. Researchers could benefit from this data bank and draw conclusions faster if they don't have to get into the pre-production phase of crawling techniques and data preparation.
### Ready-to-use data sets means more resources, faster development. 

Before you share your data, make sure of the following: 

	Are your files saved in UTF-8 with Unix line breaks?
	Are your TMX files using the correct source and target language combination? 
	Did you open your recently aligned translation memories to check for any tags or codes that could pollute the training datasets?
